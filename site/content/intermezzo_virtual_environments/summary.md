-   One big limitations of python is that only one version of a package can be installed in a given environment.
-   virtual environments allow us to create multiple python environments, isolated from each other. Therefore we don't worry
    about breaking other projects that may rely on other versions of some packages.
-   Having one virtual env per analysis is a good research practice since it faciliates reproducibility of your results.
-   never use the system python installation, unless your have a very good reason to.
