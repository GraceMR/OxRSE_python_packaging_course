Before you can distribute a package, you must first create a _distribution_.
A distribution is a single file that bundles all the files and data necessary to install and use
the package - but also sometimes compile and test it.

A distribution usually takes the from of an archive (`.tar`, `.zip` or similar).
There are several possible distribution formats, but in 2020, only two are really important: the _source distribution_ (sdist) and the _wheel_ (bdist\_wheel).


## Source distributions {#source-distributions}

Python distributions are commonly built using the `setuptools` library, _via_ the `setup.py` file.
Building a source distribution looks like this:

```shell
python setup.py sdist
```

```text
running sdist
running egg_info
writing tstools.egg-info/PKG-INFO
writing dependency_links to tstools.egg-info/dependency_links.txt
writing requirements to tstools.egg-info/requires.txt
writing top-level names to tstools.egg-info/top_level.txt
reading manifest file 'tstools.egg-info/SOURCES.txt'
writing manifest file 'tstools.egg-info/SOURCES.txt'
running check
creating tstools-0.1
creating tstools-0.1/tstools
creating tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info
copying files to tstools-0.1...
copying setup.py -> tstools-0.1
copying tstools/__init__.py -> tstools-0.1/tstools
copying tstools/show_extremes.py -> tstools-0.1/tstools
copying tstools/tstools.py -> tstools-0.1/tstools
copying tstools.egg-info/PKG-INFO -> tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info
copying tstools.egg-info/SOURCES.txt -> tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info
copying tstools.egg-info/dependency_links.txt -> tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info
copying tstools.egg-info/requires.txt -> tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info
copying tstools.egg-info/top_level.txt -> tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info
Writing tstools-0.1/setup.cfg
creating dist
Creating tar archive
removing 'tstools-0.1' (and everything under it)
```

This mainly does three things:

-   It gathers the python source files that consitute the package (incuding the `setup.py`).
-   It writes some metadata about the package in a directory `<package name>.egg-info`.
-   It bundles everyting into a tar archive.

The newly created sdist is written in a directory `dist` next to the `setup.py` file:

```shell
tar --list -f dist/tstools-0.1.tar.gz
```

```text
tstools-0.1/
tstools-0.1/PKG-INFO
tstools-0.1/setup.cfg
tstools-0.1/setup.py
tstools-0.1/tstools/
tstools-0.1/tstools/__init__.py
tstools-0.1/tstools/vis.py
tstools-0.1/tstools/moments.py
tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info/
tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info/PKG-INFO
tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info/SOURCES.txt
tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info/dependency_links.txt
tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info/requires.txt
tstools-0.1/tstools.egg-info/top_level.txt
```

As the name suggest a source distribution is nothing more than the source code of your package,
along with the `setup.py` necessary to install it.
Anyone with the source distribution therefore has everything they need to install your package.
Actually it's even possible to give the sdist directly to `pip`:

```shell
pip install tstools-0.1.tar.gz
```

And you're done!


## Wheel distributions {#wheel-distributions}

Source distributions are very basic, and installing them basically amount
to running the package's `setup.py` script.
These poses two issues:

-   In addition to the call to `setup`, the `setup.py` can contain any valid Python.
    Thinking about security for moment, this means that installing a package could
    result in the execution of malicious code.
-   To install from a source distribution, `pip` must first unpack the distribution, then
    execute the `setup.py` script. Directly unpacking to the correct location in the python
    path would be much faster.
-   Package can contain code written in a compiled language like C or Fortran. Source
    distributions assume that the recipient has all the tools necesseray to compile
    this code. Compiling code can also takes time (hours!).

This issues can be overcome by using _wheel distributions_.
For pure-Python packages, a wheel is very similar to a source distribution: it's an
archive that contains both the python source of the package and some metadata.
The main difference with sdists is that **wheels doesn't require pip to execute
the `setup.py`** file, instead the content of wheels is directly unpacked in the correct
location - most likely your current environment's `site-packages/` directory.
This makes the installation of wheels both safer and faster.

Another very important feature of python wheels is that they can embed compiled code,
effectively alleviating the need for the recipient to compile (_build_) anything.
As a result, the wheel is platform-dependant, but makes the installation considerably easier
and faster. For this reason, wheels are part of the family of _built distrubtions_.
Another type of built distribution is the python _egg_. However, the wheel format was
created in response to the shortcomings of Python eggs and this format is now obsolete.
See [Wheel vs Egg](https://packaging.python.org/discussions/wheel-vs-egg/) on the Python Packaging User Guide.


### Activity 5 - Building a Python wheel {#activity-5-building-a-python-wheel}

1.  If you don't have one, create a new developement virtual environment in the
    `tstools-dist` directory:

    ```shell
    python -m venv tstools-venv
    source tstools-venv/bin/activate # (GNU/Linux and MacOS)
    tstools-venv\Scripts\activate.bat # (Windows command prompt)
    tstools-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # (Windows PowerShell)
    ```
2.  Update `pip`

    ```shell
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
3.  Install `setuptools` and the `wheel` extension:

    ```shell
    pip install setuptools wheel
    ```
4.  Build a wheel

    ```shell
    python setup.py bdist_wheel
    ```
5.  Install the wheel using `pip`.
    Hint: wheels are written in the `dist/` directory, next to the `setup.py` file, just
    like source distributions.
6.  `.whl` files are basically zip files. Unzip the wheel and explore its contents.

{{% notice note %}}
The `bdist_wheel` command is only available after the package [wheel](https://pypi.org/project/wheel/) is installed in your current environment.
It is an extension to the `setuptools` package.
