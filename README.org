#+TITLE: Organise and share your python projects with python packages

In this workshop you will learn how to turn a couple of python scripts into
a full blown Python package. You will see how you can develop and maintain
this package independantly from your research projects and "pip install" to
reuse it across them, using virtual environments.
You will then learn the simple steps to make it possible for anyone to "pip
install" your package, automatically installing the required dependencies.

** Contents

- *I* Making a python package from a collection of python sripts
- *II* Reusing package(s) across research projects
- *III* Python virtual environments
- *IV* Sharing your package with the world
- *V* Overview of advanced topics

** Course requirements
- A basic familiarity with Python 3
- Python 3, pip and Git installed.


** Getting ready for the course
The course assumes that he following software is installed on your system:
- Python 3 (3.3 or above)
- The ~pip~ package manager to upload and download Python packages.
- The ~venv~ Python module to create Python virtual environments.

Not sure? Just [[* Check your installation][check your Python installation]].

If you already have the above requirements satisfied, jump to [[https://github.com/OxfordRSE/python-packaging-course#setup-the-python-environment-for-the-course][Setup the python environment for the course]].
Otherwise, read on.

*** How to install Python 3
    
    There are may ways of installing Python 3, depending on your
    operating system, but also what you want to use Python for.
    Perhaps the most straightforward way to install a "ready to go"
    Python is to install [[https://www.anaconda.com/][Anaconda]]. You can view Anaconda as a bundle
    including Python itself + useful utilities (such as the ~pip~
    package manager) + several gigabytes worth of Python packages.  An
    alternative to Anaconda is [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][Miniconda]], which is essentially a
    stripped version of Anaconda.  It provides a lighter Python
    distribution consisting of just Python + a handful of core
    utility packages.
    
    For the purpose of this course, it really doesn't matter if you
    install Miniconda or Anaconda. If you'd rather save some disk
    space and go for a shorter download, we recommend you go for
    Miniconda.

    - Click [[https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation][here]] for instructions on how to install Miniconda/Anaconda.

    If you'd rather install Python outside of Anaconda or Miniconda,
    check out [[https://oxfordrse.github.io/python-packaging-course/appendix_installing_python/#install-python-3-outside-of-anacondaminiconda][our instructions]] on how to install Python 3 outside of
    Anaconda/Miniconda.

    If you encounter issues whilst installing any of the above, feel
    free to get in touch by [[https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue][opening an issue]] on this repository.

*** Check your installation

*Note*: If you installed Python withing Anaconda or Miniconda, and the
~(base)~ environment is activated, replace ~python3~ by ~python~ in the following.

#+begin_src shell :results output
python3 --version
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Python 3.8.5

#+begin_src shell :results output
python3 -m pip --version
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: pip 20.2.3 from /home/thibault/.pyenv/versions/python-pkg-workshop/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)

#+begin_src shell :results output
python3 -m venv --help
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
usage: venv [-h] [--system-site-packages] [--symlinks | --copies] [--clear]
            [--upgrade] [--without-pip] [--prompt PROMPT]
            ENV_DIR [ENV_DIR ...]

Creates virtual Python environments in one or more target directories.
...
#+end_example

If any of the three commands above results in an error, please refer to 
the [[https://github.com/OxfordRSE/python-packaging-course#installing-python-3][installation instructions]]. If you get stuck, just [[https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue][open an issue]] 
this repository and we'll help you.

If not, congratulations! Python 3 is now installed and ready to go.
One last step, let's [[* Setup the python environment for the course][setup the python environment for the course]].

*** Setup the python environment for the course
**** 0. Make sure you have Git installed.
The following commands are meant to be entered in a terminal (GNU/Linux or MacOS).
#+begin_example
$ git --version
#+end_example

If not, please install Git. On GNU/Linux Git is available /via/ your package manager, for instance
on Ubuntu:
#+begin_example
$ sudo apt install git
#+end_example

On MacOS, you can use [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] once again:
#+begin_example
$ brew install git
#+end_example

On Windows, we recommend that you use [[https://git-scm.com/download/win][Git for Windows]].

**** 1. Clone the course GitHub repository
Open a terminal (on Windows you can use git-bash or the Anaconda prompt) and run the following command:
#+begin_example
$ git clone https://github.com/OxfordRSE/python-packaging-course.git
#+end_example

**** 2. Create a Python virtual environment
Next, let's move into the course directory and create a virtual
environment.  Once this virtual environment activated, you'll work in
isolation from other Python versions installed on your machine, and
you can install any packages you want without fear or breaking any
dependencies for your other work.

*Note*: If you installed Python withing Anaconda or Miniconda, and the
~(base)~ environment is activated, replace ~python3~ by ~python~ in the following.

Open a terminal (or the Anaconda prompt/command prompt if you're using Windows) and enter the following commands:
#+begin_example
$ cd python-packaging-course/
$ python3 -m venv python-course-venv # just "python" for Anaconda/Miniconda
# The following is GNU/Linux and MacOS only
$ source python-course-venv/bin/activate # This activates the virtual environment
#+end_example

On windows use the following instead to activate the virtual environment.
#+begin_example
python-course-venv\Scripts\activate.bat
#+end_example

**** 3. Setup the course
Now that your Python 3 virtual environment is activated, typing
~python~ at the command line will automatically call the Python 3
versions which was used to create the virtual environment (give
~python --version~ a try).

Let's get the latest version of the Python package manager and install
the packages required to run the examples in the course.
#+begin_example 
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
$ python -m pip install course_setup/
#+end_example

**** 4. Deactivate your environment
You're done. You can deactivate your environment with the following command:
#+begin_example
$ deactivate
#+end_example

See you at the workshop!
